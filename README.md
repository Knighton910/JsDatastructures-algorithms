This is a repo for my learning of Data Structures & Algorithms in javascript

--
I'm starting with chap4 of Data Structures & algorithms with javascript book:pdf

And I've done prior algorithms work, but this will be my first time documenting my learning of them.

Stack Operations
A stack is a list of elements that are accessible only from one end of the list, which is called the top. One common, real-world example of a stack is the stack of trays at a cafeteria. Trays are always removed from the top, and when trays are put back on the stack after being washed, they are placed on the top of the stack. The stack is known as a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
